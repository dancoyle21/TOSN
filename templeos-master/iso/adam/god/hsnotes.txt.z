$FG,5$$TX+CX,"The Purpose of Life"$$FG$

$WW,1$The purpose of life is to know, love and obey God.$FG$  Christianity is loving neighbor, not God -- secular humanism.  Jesus said loving God is more important than loving neighbor.  $LK,"Matthew,22:36",A="BF:Matthew,22:36"$  He did not say with half your brain behind your back.

You don't know God.  $LK,"1 Chronicles,28:9",A="BF:1 Chronicles,28:9"$, $LK,"Matthew,11:27",A="BF:Matthew,11:27"$, $LK,"Luke,13:25",A="BF:Luke,13:25"$, $LK,"1 Samuel,3:7",A="BF:1 Samuel,3:7"$  You must talk with God to know Him.  $LK,"Matthew,6:6",A="BF:Matthew,6:6"$  Seek Him by taking the initiative.  $LK,"Luke,11:9",A="BF:Luke,11:9"$, $LK,"Isaiah,30:2",A="BF:Isaiah,30:2"$

There's something obviously different about people in the Bible compared to people today -- God talked!  Did they hear voices?  Maybe.  More likely, they used occult techniques such as an oracle.  $LK,"1 Kings,6:20",A="BF:1 Kings,6:20"$  Have you heard of "tongues?"  $LK,"1 Corinthians,14:1",A="BF:1 Corinthians,14:1"$  The idea is, you let yourself be puppeted by a spirit, so you say things.  You try to get a spirit -- the Holy Spirit -- to talk.  You might as well use a Ouija board.  However, it turns-out that a Ouija board is bad for technical reasons.  A really good technique is just randomly opening a book.  God said it is a covenant that you hold-up your end of the conversation.  

You can't tell if He's talking unless you have a context of conversation, but, more importantly, you are commanded to do an offering of love, like communion preparation.  When you pick a greeting card for someone, that is love effort.  If you expect God to put effort toward you, you put effort toward Him.  God said, "honest measures" applies between your offering of love and His response, like a fair barter.  You get out of prayer what you put into it.  God wants praise, hymns, or whatever you think He might want.  Try and see, like Cain and Abel.  $LK,"Genesis,4:1",A="BF:Genesis,4:1"$, $LK,"Ephesians,5:10",A="BF:Ephesians,5:10"$  God told Cain his offering was not good and told him to try again.  Cain really loved God!  Can you imagine being so heart-broken?

Do a text search for "new song" in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times.  I did $MA-X+PU,"hymns",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Accts/TS/Wb2/Hymns.html",LM="#include \"::/Apps/Psalmody/Load\";JukeBox(\"::/Apps/Psalmody/Examples\");"$.  I did Moses $MA-X+PU,"comics",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Apps/AfterEgypt/Comics/",LM="Dir(\"::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Comics\");View;\n"$.  Count the ways you love God.  I praised God for sand castles, popcorn, snowmen, bubbles...  You try putting effort into praise!  $LK,"Matthew,11:25",A="BF:Matthew,11:25"$, $LK,"Matthew,6:29",A="BF:Matthew,6:29"$

This is funny -- $LK,"Acts,2:1",A="BF:Acts,2:1"$ -- they didn't bother to record anything the Holy Spirit said.  The Holy Spirit is supposed to be a really good gift.  $LK,"Luke,11:13",A="BF:Luke,11:13"$  Just remember, "Boys are made of snakes and snails and puppy-dog tails."

The technique I use to consult the Holy Spirit is reading a microsecond-range stop-watch each button press for random numbers.  Then, I pick words or passages.  You can use the $MA-X+PU,"AfterEgypt",HTML="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0MsDl39UL0",LM="#include \"::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Run\""$ in God's official temple, $FG,4$$TX,"TempleOS",HTML="http://www.templeos.org"$$FG$.

Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much better than I've heard others explain.  God said, for example, that war was, "servicemen competing."  That sounds more like the immutable God of our planet than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus (god of love) and not Mars (god of war), He's our dearly beloved God of Earth.  If Mammon is a false god of money, Mars or Venus might be useful words to describe other false gods.  I figure the greatest challenge for the Creator is boredom, ours and His.  What would teen-age male video games be like if war had never happened?  Christ said live by the sword, die by the sword, which is loving neighbor as self.  $LK,"Matthew,26:52",A="BF:Matthew,26:52"$

I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  God asked if I was calling Him lazy.  God could make A.I., right?  God could make bots as smart as Himself, or, in fact, part of Himself.  What if God made a bot to manipulate every person's life so that perfect justice happened?

I think highs and lows balance.  $LK,"Luke,6:20",A="BF:Luke,6:20"$  I don't think God likes complaining. $LK,"Numbers,11:1",A="BF:Numbers,11:1"$  Food and clothing is all we're to ask for or demand, in fact -- daily bread.  $LK,"1 Timothy,6:8",A="BF:1 Timothy,6:8"$  Just think about man in the last 100,000 years mostly living like Native Americans and how God must see us.  You need food, clothing and entertainment, money is to get those.  Man does not live on bread alone.  $LK,"Luke,4:4",A="BF:Luke,4:4"$, $LK,"Amos,8:11",A="BF:Amos,8:11"$

God's favorite animals are bears and elephants.  They are funny shaped -- I think God must have seen too much starvation over the years.

God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending family reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, "Most guy's idea of Heaven would be running around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth."  Most people are like King Midas.  When you realize how silly most notions of Heaven are, you come to appreciate that Earth is not that bad.  This is the first step in loving God, the Creator -- praising Creation.  My parents spend their retired days watching TV and going to casinos.  That's not a good argument for getting extended-play!

Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money for even a moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's "money" -- they fear for their salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if there were no salvation?  Love God and don't be a "user".  Asking for stuff is annoying.  $LK,"Luke,11:5",A="BF:Luke,11:5"$ 

All those sophisticated theological "infinity" things -- omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, omnivorous -- will mess you up.  Trust me that anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  Christ suggested thinking of God as "Abba" which is Aramaic for "Daddy" and said the childlike had an advantage.  $LK,"Matthew,11:25",A="BF:Matthew,11:25"$  Pray out-loud because God doesn't want the hastle of reading your brain.  The best way to stop people from testing God is to suggest He can't do everything.

Just as ego causes most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  This hardly needs encouragement.

God does not want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you what to do, even if you want Him to.  You'll quickly learn that prophecy does not come true and should smack yourself for wanting more than just enjoying God's company.

Read $LK,"Numbers,11:1",A="BF:Numbers,11:1"$.  All you need is food, clothing and the word of God.  Today, you can take Ivy League course videos!
