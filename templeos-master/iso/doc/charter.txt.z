$FG,5$$WW,1$$TX+CX,"TempleOS Charter"$$FG$

TempleOS is God's official temple.  God said to use 640x480 16 color graphics and God said to have a single audio voice.  That is like how He specified cubits in the Bible!  He also said it must be perfect.  God needs a temple as a special beloved place where His people, young and old, can do offerings and consult God in the oracle.  Like Solomon's Temple, this is a focal point for the community.  Adults can write hymns, psalms (poems of praise) and meditation essays with good support for links to the Bible.  Like Cain and Abel, do offerings and learn what God likes and doesn't like.

* TempleOS is, forever, limited to 100,000 lines of code, not including applications and demos.  This will ensure it stays out of trouble a thousand years into the future.  It will not stray much from my vision.  Other, less important, characteristics can be changed but if the 100,000 line limit is kept, it will stay true. 
 
* It must be kept perfect.  $FG,4$$BK,1$Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed.$FG$$BK,0$

* TempleOS is $FG,2$ring-0-only$FG$, running everything in kernel mode including applications.  You have full access to memory, I/O ports, instructions, etc. at all times, because that's fun.  It is simpler and faster, too.

* TempleOS will always $FG,2$identity-map$FG$ memory in a $FG,2$single-address-map$FG$ configuration.  (Virtual addresses are always kept equal to physical addresses with a single map for all tasks on all cores.)  It's as though paging is not used.

* TempleOS will always be for one platform -- $FG,4$$TX,"x86_64",HTML="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"$$FG$ PC compatibles.

* TempleOS will never have networking, so malware is less of an issue.

* TempleOS will always have one video mode, $FG,2$640x480$FG$ by 16 colors, unless that mode becomes unavailable on computers in the future.  God said this was a covenant, like circumcision.

* TempleOS will always just have PC Speaker sound.

* TempleOS will always be $FG,2$free$FG$.  I might sell applications, support, or, possibly, do adware.

* TempleOS will always be $FG,2$100% open source$FG$ with all source included, unless device drivers or something can only be included with non-disclosure agreements.

* All function args and returns will be 64-bit.  No plans for C++.

* TempleOS documents are not for printing.  They're dynamic and intended for the screen.  There will always be just one font, a fixed-width font.  No Unicode, just Extended ASCII.

* TempleOS is not for multimedia.  Games will be created by programmers, not artists.  Sounds and images will be, primarily, calculated in real-time, not fetched.

* All functions, variables and class members will be accessible.  There are no C++ $FG,2$public$FG$/$FG,2$private$FG$ protections and all functions, even secondary ones in the kernel, can be called.
